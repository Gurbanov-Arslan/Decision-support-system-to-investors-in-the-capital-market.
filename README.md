This application I developed in R studio using the R shiny package. The application uses data from Yahoo Finance and gets it with quantmod package in real-time.
For stock price prediction I used an algorithm support vector machine. The data used in the modelling are the calendar days and the closing price of stocks.
And application generates two types of characteristics: Date and Closing price gap.
